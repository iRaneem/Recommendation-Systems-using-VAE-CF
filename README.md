# Variational Autoencoders for Collaborative Filtering


Our goal is to explore a research paper, implement its findings, and further improve upon the proposed methodology. Through our implementation and enhancements, we strive to contribute to the advancement of personalized recommendations and push the boundaries of existing techniques. By conducting thorough evaluations, we aim to gain valuable insights and draw meaningful conclusions that can guide future developments in the field of recommendation systems.

## Introduction

In our journey through a recommendation system course project, we embarked on an exciting exploration of recommendation system and dive deep into its concepts, implement its findings, and push the boundaries of its capabilities to improve and innovate in the field of personalized recommendations. The major challenging “small-data” problem where most users only interact with a tiny proportion of the items and our goal is to collectively make informed inference about each user’s preference . we find that to make use of the sparse signals from users and avoid overfitting, we build a probabilistic latent-variable model that shares statistical strength among users and items. Empirically, we show that employing a principled Bayesian approach is more robust regardless of the scarcity of the data.  However, we did not stop at mere replication. We fine-tuned parameters of the Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) , explored alternative dataset to create a functional system that could generate personalized recommendations.
